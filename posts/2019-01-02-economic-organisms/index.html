<h2 id="life">Life</h2>

<p>Socioeconomic systems may be conceived in the same vein as organisms:
driven, replicated, non-equilibrium systems in a landscape of steady-states.
Lifetimes and sustainability in such systems are parameterized by the capacity to
represent and predict driving signals, and to use the energy contained in such signals
to replicate successfully.</p>

<p>Driving signals are the cycles of availability of input energy that drive systems out
of equilibrium. Driven systems favour the formation of well-organized, low-entropy structures
to the extent that they are better able than high-entropy forms to
store, utilize, and ultimately dissipate input energy.</p>

<p>This is what makes life inevitable yet absurd in our universe -
beauty in form derived from superiority in destruction.</p>

<h2 id="markets">Markets</h2>

<p>Organisms and economic systems are assemblages of
cells and datastructures encoding driving signals
like biochemical nutrients, electromagnetic radiation,
physical forces, and the presence of others.</p>

<p>In organisms, the cells and data structures are biophysical;
in economies, they are socio-political.
In economies, the presence of others plays a
disproportionately powerful role as signal and source of energy.</p>

<p>Market data structures (prices, exchanges, commercial law, etc.) have been paramount to our ability
to represent the presence of others, and to co-ordinate with other humans at large scale
by mediating exchange between otherwise entirely unrelated people.</p>

<p>This is a representational problem and solution. The problem is, how do I represent the presence of unknown, unrelated agents?
For most of history, the solution was primarily as &ldquo;other, probably hostile&rdquo;, precipitating much of our bloody past.
But with markets and currencies, the representation of unknown,
unrelated agents becomes suddenly &ldquo;opportunity to exchange value&rdquo;;
an astounding change in posture that lubricates co-operation across a tremendous range of peoples.</p>

<h2 id="decoupling">Decoupling</h2>

<p>Of course, market structures have been used in highly absuive contexts as well, for instance in their original
encounter with native people&rsquo;s of so many lands, and in the debt slavery they perpetuate today.
These abuses are similar in that they both constitute an unprecendented decoupling of the representational state
of the system from its environment.</p>

<p>In the former case, invaders by-and-large obliterated age-old customs for survival,
customs deeply embedded with representations of the myriad patterns of the enviornment,
replacing them with cross-platform industrial mechanisms with global supply chains
that care little for local rhythms or sustainability.</p>

<p>In the latter case, the credit bubble, across humans and nations, has long out-paced the capacity of its debtors to repay,
and hence interest rates have all but ceased to be useful in their representation of economic potential
and credit-worthiness in the global economy.</p>

<p>Arguably, this decoupling of representation from environment, and its corresponding implications for our sustainability,
is a symptom of the insufficiency of existing market mechanisms to adequately represent our environments
as our population sizes collide with our carrying-capacities.</p>

<p>Indeed, the idea that the central bank will stabilize the economy with a single lever,
the interest rate, is laughable in its ignorance of the essence of stability and the complexity
of our social economics.</p>

<h2 id="dollars">Dollars</h2>

<p>What should the central bank due to promote stability in its economy? It should be obvious:
nurture, promote, and protect the self-sufficiency of its regions.
International trade is a luxury. In so far as it is a critical dependency for any region,
there is work to do.</p>

<p>The dominance of dollar-denominated international trade has canabilized the global pricing mechanism and systematized fragility.
Hence why it literally costs less to ship something from China than from across the street,
and why it&rsquo;s become increasingly difficult for people in urban centers to meet their basic needs.</p>

<p>The representational capacity of local systems (ie. their sustainability) appears to have been
chronically undermined by the adoption of an internationalized currency to denominate all exchange -
local capacity devalues so-far as it cannot be priced and shipped in global markets.</p>

<h2 id="value">Value</h2>

<p>Typically, currency is considered to play three roles:
medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. Global currencies have succeeded significantly in the first two,
but utterly failed in the third, as their values have become increasingly decoupled from reality,
and increasingly coupled to crippling debt.
Precious metals, conversely, have stored value considerably well, despite their failure as media of exchange and units of account.
As the currency degrades in its representational capacity, so too does it
degrade as a store-of-value.</p>

<p>What does it mean to store value? It is to harbour potential energy in a usable way.
Natural ecosystems and organisms have highly distributed stores of value,
across a great many forms, allowing them to respond robustly to fluctuations in input energy.
They also have currencies, energy carrying molecules like ATP and NADH that are accepted
roughly everywhere. Value is transferred across systems by the exchange of currencies.</p>

<p>But humans have steadily abstracted our value stores away from their underlying
energetic forms, decoupling them from the salient driving signals that sustain us.
In turn, we have become increasingly dependent on large, fragile, hierarchical, and global systems
to provide their basic needs, using the dollar as a mediator.</p>

<p>Can we integrate local stores of value with global markets in a manner that
doesn&rsquo;t undermine the local systems? Can we empower both local sustainability and global integration?</p>
