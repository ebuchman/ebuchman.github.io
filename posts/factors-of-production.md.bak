*This is the intro to a 3 part series on the factors of production*:

- Part I - Character of the Factors of Production (TBD)
- Part II - Land, Labour, Capital (TBD)
- Part III - Energy, Money (TBD)

The great tragedy of mainstream, neoclassical economics is that, 
in trying to transform the Classical political-economy of the 19th century 
into a more mathematical science of economics, it butchered its political and moral foundation. 

It all started with a good idea - from Menger, Jevons, and Walras - 
of the subjective nature of value and the marginal utility of goods.
The "marginal revolution", as we know it today, enabled supply and demand to be
treated analytically with the tools of calculus, and for equations to be solved
that maximize utility and minimize costs. This seemed to work well in 
isolated, simple circumstances, say the market for a particular commodity.
But the techniques were rapidly applied to model more complex chains of
production, and even entire economies. In doing so, the field got carried away in 
grossly insufficient, if not negligent, mathematical representations of the
structures of production, and of the human and natural worlds that support them.

The insufficiency, and moral derelict, of modern neoclassical economics is
widely known and understood. Hence the growing prominence of so-called
heterodox schools: Austrian, Ecological, Feminist, Georgist, Institutional,
Post-Keynesian, etc. There are truths in each of these. What we seek is a
heterodox synthesis.

Consider that the trouble with economics perhaps lies in our conception of the
factors of production themselves (land, labour, capital, etc.) -
that we are suffering from an incomplete social theory of these factors
and their relationships to eachother.
Neoclassical economics has dramatically, if not imorally, oversimplified 
in its treatment of the factors.

Each heterodox school is in some sense associated with a critique of one or another factor:
the Georgists with Land, the Feminists and Institutionalists with Labour,
the Austrians and Post-Keynesians with Capital (and also with Money)
and the Ecological economists with Energy.
Even the central bankers are calling bullshit on the neoclassical 
descriptions of money!

The factors of Land and Labour, the very substance of natural and
human life, have been reduced to mere commodity - as Polanyi calls them,
*fictitious commodities*. The factor of Capital has been woefully misunderstood
and its theory stunted, at least since the Cambridge Capital Controversy died in
the 1960s, if not since Hayek stopped working on it in 1940. The factor of
Energy is largely excluded all together, or else included without any regard for the
laws of thermodynamics. And the factor of Money, if it is not confused up with
that of Capital, is hardly even considered a factor at all.

Here we call for a reconsideration of the factors of production
as a basis for a more sound political-economy.
We strive to be truer to the character of each factor, and to the relationships
between them. We consider that the factors emerge out of each other, in order,
beginning with Land, and proceeding with Labour, Capital, Energy, and Money. 
Higher order factors, in turn, feedback on lower-order ones, thereby
transforming them.
Each factor has associated with it a "cost" - let's call them rent, wages, capital interest,
entropy, and money interest - and each expands the scope of activity possible on
Land by introducing a new dimension - call them space, time, energy, and coordination.
We find our approach to be somewhat of a heterdox synthesis.

This sketch will proceed in three parts.
In part I, we briefly review the mainstream conception of the factors of
production, and we sketch an outline of our heterodox synthesis.
In part II, we review the factors of Land, Labour and Capital. 
In part III, we review the factors of Energy and Money.
