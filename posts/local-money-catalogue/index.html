<h1 id="local-money-systems">Local Money Systems</h1>

<p>As you may know, I&rsquo;m quite enchanted with the idea of local money systems
- moneys designed to facilitate local economic organization and trade.
There&rsquo;s a nice overview in Bernard Lietar&rsquo;s <a href="https://newsociety.com/products/9780865716674">Creating Wealth</a>.
I think they&rsquo;re the best application of blockchain tech and the best hope for
a sustainable civilization.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-local-money">Types of Local Money</h2>

<p>The simplest local money is <em>custodial</em>. You give $100 to some trusted local
organization, and they give you 100 LOCAL in return. You can spend the LOCAL in the
community, or you can cash it back it in, but say for only 95 cents on the
dollar. The idea is to keep the money circulating in the community. The money is
backed by custodial reserves (dollars at the trusted org). Examples include
[BerhShares], TODO, etc.</p>

<p>Another kind of local money is <em>mutual credit</em>. You join a cooperative of
businesses that accept payments for goods and services in LOCAL on par with $.
You take out a loan of 100 LOCAL (ie. 100 LOCAL are created and issued to you!),
but you must commit to accept say 500 LOCAL (on par with $)
in the future as payment for your goods or services. The money is backed by the mutual committment
to accept it (on par with $) for goods and services. The best example of this is
the [WIR Bank] in Switzerland, which started during the Great Depression, and
is the longest running and largest local money system in the world. But see also
<a href="https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/">Grassroots Economics</a> and [Sardex].</p>

<p>Another kind of local money is invoice or <em>trade credit clearing</em>. You join a cooperative of
businesses that do business with eachother. You owe money to some of your
suppliers, who owe money to some of their suppliers, who owe money to you.
Any closed loop of obligations like this (a &ldquo;cycle&rdquo;) can be <em>netted</em> out, reducing the
overall amount anyone has to pay. While this doesn&rsquo;t feel so much like money in
an account, it does reduce the amount of money you would otherwise need to settle your payments.
Examples include TODO.</p>

<p>Similar to invoice clearing are <em>clearing houses</em>. Instead of only netting out the
cycles and leaving the remaining obligations in place between businesses,
a clearing house serves as a central counterparty to net <em>everyone</em> against everyone
else. Businesses with deficits pay the clearing house, and those with surpluses
collect from it.</p>

<p>There are a number of other kinds of local money, but these seem to be the most prominent,
and potentially the most scalable.</p>

<h2 id="liquidity-saving-mechanisms">Liquidity Saving Mechanisms</h2>

<p>Earlier this year, a paper was published by Tomaz Fleischman on
<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/13/12/295">Liquidity Saving Mechanisms</a>. The paper seemed to so illuminate the field of local money systems
that a review was written called <a href="https://mutualcredit.services/2021/02/18/someone-just-turned-the-lights-on/">Someone Just Turned the
Lights on</a>. The paper analyzed data from two real world local money systems:
a national trade credit clearing system in Slovenia, and a mutual credit system
in Sardinia. The paper contains some incredible visualizations of the cyclic structures within the
larger obligation graph, and how obligation clearing improves the liquidity
profile of firms.</p>

<p>Tomaz&rsquo;s paper highlighted the major beneficial impact these systems have had
on their respective economies, specifically in terms of the liquidity
saved (ie. payment obligations reduced) by participating businesses. Hence the term, liquidity
saving mechanisms. But it also showed through simulations how much more could be
saved by combining the two mechanisms - namely, the combination of invoice clearing
and mutual credit could save businesses up to 50% (!) of their liquidity needs!
That&rsquo;s huge.</p>

<p>As it turns out, liquidity savings mechanisms are a reasonably well studied
concept in economics, though primarily in the context of financial institutions. Banks regularly
use liquidity savings mechanisms (especially clearing houses) to reduce the need
for payments to be settled with $ or otherwise, just by netting out participants
against eachother. Banks do this every single day in clearing houses like CHIPS
and the Federal Reserve itself, saving themselves on the order of trillions of
dollars of liquidity per year. We need only to make these tools available to
the general public.</p>

<h2 id="trust-and-risk">Trust and Risk</h2>

<p>Monetary systems are a manifestation of a kind of trust between people.
Money has its origins in tit-for-tat social exchanges - I do something for you
today, you do something for me <em>in the future</em>. This is a kind of value storage.
I have to trust that you&rsquo;ll follow through, of couse, but by doing so I can reduce my
uncertainty about the future. These kinds of bilateral credit relationships are fundamental to the evolutionary
success of social mammals, like chimpanzees, and ultimately humans.</p>

<p>Money is a generalization and externalization of this kind of credit.
It equips the credit function with a standard of value (&ldquo;unit of account&rdquo;),
and enables it to be settled any time (&ldquo;means of exchange&rdquo;).</p>

<p>&hellip; substruycture matters &hellip; ? &hellip; what is the source of the trust
relationship? what does it reflect about the world ? governance, stability,
systemic risk. blockchins allow us to scale new systems. municipal currencies ?
MMT at level of Fed may be too big/dangerous. bring it down, achieve
sustainabilitiy (&ldquo;real productive capacity&rdquo; ? )</p>

<p>Liquidity savings provides better representation
mutual credit is better than bank credit</p>

<p>source of trust, source of risk &hellip;
how to manage risk ? socialize it? heart of capitalism and anti-trust. rewards
to match risk ?</p>

<p>how to bound growth ?
representing your boundaries - hurricane vs lotus</p>

<p>free capital flows
stable exchange
monetary sovereignty</p>

<h3 id="grassroots-economics">Grassroots Economics</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/">Grassroots Economics</a> is a non-profit in Kenya running a program called
<a href="https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/community-currencies">Community Inclusion Currencies</a> that is a mix of mutual credit and custodial
money but using bonding curve techniques. They have ~40,000 businesses in Kenya using the system to trade with
eachother. It&rsquo;s built as a Solidity application, originally a fork of the
<a href="https://bancor.network/">Bancor</a> bonding curve system. They were initially using the <a href="https://www.poa.network/">POA</a> blockchain
(an Ethereum sidechain) and it&rsquo;s xDAI stablecoin (basically just the <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/">DAI</a>
stablecoin from Ethereum moved over the bridge onto the POA chain) but even
just needing to pay for gas to move DAI from Ethereum to POA was too expensive
so they moved to <a href="https://bloxberg.org/">Bloxberg</a>, an Ethereum blockchain run by a consortium of
universities.</p>

<p>The founder of the project is <a href="https://modernmoneynetwork.org/participants/will-ruddick">Will Ruddick</a>. He&rsquo;s been working on economic
development in East Africa for over a decade. We&rsquo;ve been following eachother for
some time but had our first call the other week. Turns out he&rsquo;s working with
Althea on deploying mesh nets in Kenya. He&rsquo;s working with the World Food Program
and the Red Cross on the community currency projects, and they&rsquo;re even starting
to run their own blockchain nodes. He has a vision of the humanitarian space
evolving standards bodies and validators that better enable communtiy
groups to come together and fund public work and social services.</p>

<p>Grassroots was initially a training org that did a local currency
project with printed vouchers. They eventually used some SQL database. Then
moved to POA and Bancor. They&rsquo;re still evolving their tech stack and looking for
something more long term maintainable. He&rsquo;s pretty interested in moving to
Cosmos, and also in leveraging Rust.</p>

<p>They have some pretty neat live data from the project
<a href="https://dashboard.sarafu.network/">here</a> and there&rsquo;s more documentation
<a href="https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics/cic-docs">here</a>. I plan to go through
this in more detail on Pi-Week and to try and play around with the app a bit.</p>
