## Trust and Risk

Monetary systems are a manifestation of a kind of trust between people.
Money has its origins in tit-for-tat social exchanges - I do something for you
today, you do something for me *in the future*. This is a kind of value storage. 
I have to trust that you'll follow through, of couse, but by doing so I can reduce my 
uncertainty about the future. These kinds of bilateral credit relationships are fundamental to the evolutionary 
success of social mammals, like chimpanzees, and ultimately humans. 

Money is a generalization and externalization of this kind of credit.
It equips the credit function with a standard of value ("unit of account"),
and enables it to be settled any time ("means of exchange").

... substruycture matters ... ? ... what is the source of the trust
relationship? what does it reflect about the world ? governance, stability,
systemic risk. blockchins allow us to scale new systems. municipal currencies ? 
MMT at level of Fed may be too big/dangerous. bring it down, achieve
sustainabilitiy ("real productive capacity" ? ) 

Liquidity savings provides better representation
mutual credit is better than bank credit

source of trust, source of risk ... 
how to manage risk ? socialize it? heart of capitalism and anti-trust. rewards
to match risk ? 

how to bound growth ? 
representing your boundaries - hurricane vs lotus





free capital flows
stable exchange
monetary sovereignty

### Grassroots Economics

[Grassroots Economics] is a non-profit in Kenya running a program called
[Community Inclusion Currencies] that is a mix of mutual credit and custodial
money but using bonding curve techniques. They have ~40,000 businesses in Kenya using the system to trade with
eachother. It's built as a Solidity application, originally a fork of the
[Bancor] bonding curve system. They were initially using the [POA] blockchain
(an Ethereum sidechain) and it's xDAI stablecoin (basically just the [DAI]
stablecoin from Ethereum moved over the bridge onto the POA chain) but even 
just needing to pay for gas to move DAI from Ethereum to POA was too expensive
so they moved to [Bloxberg], an Ethereum blockchain run by a consortium of
universities.

The founder of the project is [Will Ruddick]. He's been working on economic
development in East Africa for over a decade. We've been following eachother for
some time but had our first call the other week. Turns out he's working with
Althea on deploying mesh nets in Kenya. He's working with the World Food Program
and the Red Cross on the community currency projects, and they're even starting
to run their own blockchain nodes. He has a vision of the humanitarian space
evolving standards bodies and validators that better enable communtiy
groups to come together and fund public work and social services.

Grassroots was initially a training org that did a local currency
project with printed vouchers. They eventually used some SQL database. Then
moved to POA and Bancor. They're still evolving their tech stack and looking for
something more long term maintainable. He's pretty interested in moving to
Cosmos, and also in leveraging Rust.

They have some pretty neat live data from the project
[here](https://dashboard.sarafu.network/) and there's more documentation
[here](https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics/cic-docs). I plan to go through
this in more detail on Pi-Week and to try and play around with the app a bit.
