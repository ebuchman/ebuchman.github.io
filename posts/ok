+
+Bitcoin mining gravitates to the cheapest sources of
+electricity. On the one hand, that's been coal plants in China. But on the other, it's
+renewable energy all over the world. According to recent surveys, more than half of all the mining companies
+are using renewable energy, though a majority of the mining power is still driven largely by
+Chinese coal. But these distributions are by no means static. We're witnessing today the migration of huge amounts of mining
+activity out of China by virtue of the recent mining bans. Demand for cleaner mining
+operations is apparent and growing. Further, Bitcoin mining may actually have
+the potential to *improve the viability* of renewable energy projects themselves. Solar and wind energy 
+production is notoriously variable, and it can be difficult to match demand and
+supply, a problem imperiling the viability of many renewable energy projects. By
+by functioning as a sort of "battery" that can store excess energy as financial value, Bitcoin
+mining can be used by renewable energy producers to smooth out these
+fluctuations, making an otherwise costly mismatch of demand and supply
+potentially profitable.
+
+As for Bitcoin mining devices, they may be simpler and require less extractive resources than batteries and general computers, 
+but their turnover is massive, as new, more efficient mining hardware hits the market, 
+and the state of recycling old devices is quite poor. 
+But there is reason to be optimistic, especially as Bitcoin mining devices
+are pushing up against the physical boundaries of computation - at some point it
+will not be possible to make more efficient devices without a breakthrough in
+physics and computer engineering. In any case, by grounding itself in the most
+raw expression of computing capability, Bitcoin may help incentivize the decentralization of 
+computer chip manufacturing in general, the importance of which is being made increasingly apparent
+by the COVID induced chip shortage, which is causing all kinds of dislocations
+in the supply chain.
+
+For years now, the Bitcoin mining network has been the world's largest supercomputer,
+more powerful than all the other supercomputers combined, though it is computing only a single rather simple
 function with seemingly little practical value.

+So what do we even get for all this seemingly wasted electricity? What does
+Proof-of-Work mining really provide?
+We've already alluded to a kind of *trust* that this process produces.
+We may call this form of trust *thermodynamic immutability*. 
 It means that the integrity of the historical record, 
-it's immutability, is not guaranteed by social consensus but by the thermodynamics of the universe.
-The principle of social consensus is perhaps best exemplified in the 
-adage that history is written by the victors. But Bitcoin provides a historical record 
-that is written by miners and can't be re-written without doing as much work as the original miners did.

-This is not to say that social consensus isn't involved in Bitcoin or that

-with many sources of trust. But the pumping heart of the Bitcoin network is a

+(i.e. it's immutability) is guaranteed by the thermodynamics of the universe,
+rather than the whims of politics.
+
+It is often said, in a kind of defeatest resignation to the pities of politics, 
+that history is written by the victors.
+But while victory has traditionally been available only to those that demonstrate their superiority in war and conquest,
+Bitcoin provides a form of victory that is at once accessible to all, a victory
+not defined by disciminatory political might, but by a verifiable,
+thermodynamic process. And as Bitcoin marches on, the *cost* of re-writing the
+Bitcoin history increases in proportion to the amount of computing power already spent.
+For this reason we talk about Proof-of-Work mining as providing a kind of security.
+Some call this kind of security "cryptoeconomic", in reference to the mix of
+cryptographic and economic guarantees it provides.

 advanced and robust source of trust for international agreement that we've ever
 had. This may prove to be especially important in the coming years amidst what
 appears to be increasingly turbulent geopolitical relations. International
 sources of agreement are in short supply.

-Absolutely not. They definitely shouldn't. There's little justification for 
-more than a few Proof of Work blockchains, if not just one.
-
-In fact, I've spent much of the last seven years (along with many other talented people) developing and promoting 
-an energy efficient alternative to Proof of Work called Proof of Stake.
-To a large extent, this is what the Tendermint and Cosmos projects have been
-about. And we've largely succeeded. Pretty much all major blockchains being built today use Proof of Stake instead
-of Proof of Work, and thus do away with mining and the ridiculous energy
-expenditure. There's no real excuse for any new blockchain to use mining.
-Even Ethereum, which currently uses Proof of Work and is second only to Bitcoin, 
-has begun its transition to Proof of Stake. Danny Ryan, a lead Ethereum
-researcher, explains in detail in this podcast.
-
-But as powerful as Proof of Stake is, it will never be able to provide the same
-guarantees provided by Proof of Work, no matter how close it thinks it can
-approximate them for practical purposes. And thus while Proof of Stake is
