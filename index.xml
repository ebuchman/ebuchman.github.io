      <description>On January 3rd, 2009, the great mother Goddess of cryptoeconomics, Satoshi Nakamoto, birthed her baby Bitcoin into the world. 10 years later, Bitcoin is booming, awakening cavalries of latent innovative energy and catalyzing radical new approaches to socioeconomic systems.
Bitcoin and its ilk are pushing the boundaries of critical fields of study, from fault tolerant distributed computing, to cryptography, mechanism design, and formal verification. The impact of these developments will be felt for generations.</description>

      <description>I love writing, and I want to commit to doing more of it. Once upon a time I had a good cadence going on Blogspot, and when that dropped off, I eventually picked up again on Wordpress. But it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. Now I plan to write in Vim and publish on Github while letting Hugo do the hard work of beautifying, unless you can convince me of something better.</description>

      <description>I work in software, research, education, and the garden.
The following more or less sum me up:
 &amp;ldquo;There is nothing in a caterpillar that tells you it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a butterfly.&amp;rdquo;
- Buckminster Fuller
  &amp;ldquo;There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew.&amp;rdquo;
- Marshall McLuhan
  &amp;ldquo;Human beings were invented by water as a device for transporting itself from one place to another.</description>
